If you want to hear custom music in Yandere Simulator, you'll need to convert your music to the OGG file format.

Fortunately, it's quick and easy! Just use a free website like this one: http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg

Then, just drag-and-drop the OGG into the same folder where you found this text file, and you should be able to make your music play in the game!

However, your track must use one of the following filenames:

track0.ogg
track1.ogg
track2.ogg
track3.ogg
track4.ogg
track5.ogg
track6.ogg
track7.ogg
track8.ogg
track9.ogg

No other filenames will be accepted.

Have fun!

P.S. - If you want to make the music stop playing, hit the "M" key on your keyboard! Hit the "M" key again to bring the game's original soundtrack back.
